    <h2><i> What is CSS ?</i></h2>
    <ol type="1">
       <li><strong> CSS</strong> stands for Cascading Style Sheets </li><br>
      <li><strong>CSS</strong> describes how <strong>HTML</strong> elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li><br>
      <li><m><b>Css is not necessary</b></m>&nbsp;<b><f>CSS saves a lot of work.</f></b> can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li><br>
      <li><i><k><strong> External stylesheets are in CSS files.</strong></k></i></li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2><i> CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</i></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elemental</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS , is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However ,<b><f>In this tutorial
        will use inline and internal styles.</f></b> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it 
        yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID, 
        on the other hand,applies a style to multiple elements.ID ,on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.
        ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>In CSS,selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.Once an element has
             been targeted,a style or set of styles can be applies to the element.
    </p>
    <p>There is wide range of selectors available.Two of most commonly used are class and ID,Both are used to target 
        elements to which a style should be applied.
